Building
===
1. First be sure to run the get-dependencies.ps powershell script (works on Windows and Mac). This will checkout the StratisBitcoinFullNode project, build the bits you need for testing, and copy them into a lib folder.
2. Once this is done you can open the .sln file in Visual Studio and compile, or build from the command line.
3. Finally run the tests to confirm everything is working correctly.
